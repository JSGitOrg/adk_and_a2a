For the purposes of this lab, imagine you work for a stadium maintenance company: Cymbal Stadiums. As part of a recent project, you developed an image generation-agent that can create illustrations according to your brand guidelines. Now, several different teams in your organization want to use it too.

If you were to copy the code for use as a sub-agent by many agents, it would be very difficult to maintain and improve all of these copies.

Instead, you can deploy the agent once as an agent wrapped with an A2A server, and the other teams' agents can incorporate it by querying it remotely.
